# HomePod Connect

This addons allows you to stream music directly to your HomePods from Spotify.

## Requirements
- A Spotify Premium account
- At least one HomePod
- Correct set up in the Home app
  - Home -> Home Settings -> Allow Speaker & TV Access -> Anyone On the same Network
  - Home -> Home Settings -> Allow Speaker & TV Access -> Require Password: Disabled
- VSCode addon or any other text editor to edit the configuration

## Comfort features
Additionally to this addon, I recommend to use the Home Assistant OwnTone integration. With that, you can control which HomePod should play music.

<!-- Second, there is a blueprint that allows you to automatically play music in a room as soon as someone enters it.
You can find it in the Home Assistant Community. -->
